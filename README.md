# FacialRecognitionAndAttendanceSystemUsingPython

Flask: A micro web framework for Python, used for web application development.

OpenCV (cv2): Open Source Computer Vision Library, used for various image processing tasks.

NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python, used for handling arrays and matrix operations.

face_recognition: A simple library to recognize faces from Python or from the command line.

pandas: A library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

scikit-learn: A machine learning library for Python, although it appears you're not using its functionalities extensively in the shared code snippet.

joblib: A set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in Python, often used for saving and loading machine learning models, but it doesn't appear to be actively used in the shared code snippet.

Install All dependencies:
//pip install Flask
//pip install numpy
//pip install opencv-python
//pip install face_recognition
//pip install pandas
//pip install scikit-learn
//pip install joblib

SQLite3: Comes pre-installed with Python for database operations.

Additionally, you'll need:

CMake: For compiling the dlib dependency of the face_recognition library, especially when installing it.
To install these dependencies with Python's package manager pip, you can use the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install Flask
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
pip install face_recognition
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install joblib

Note: sqlite3 is part of the Python Standard Library, so it does not require installation through pip.

Remember to install CMake if you're setting up face_recognition and encounter any issues related to dlib. You can follow the platform-specific installation instructions for CMake provided in a previous response.
